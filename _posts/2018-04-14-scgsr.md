I am one of 60 PhD candidates to receive an award from the [Department of Energy Office of Science Graduate Student Research program](https://science.energy.gov/wdts/scgsr/).
My appointment is at Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, IL (near Chicago) for the summer and fall 2018 semesters.
[Here is RPI's article about my work and the award.](https://news.rpi.edu/content/2018/04/13/better-tools-supercomputer-research)
