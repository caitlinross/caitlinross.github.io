<p>I'm a PhD student in the computer science department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  
My current research is in parallel discrete event simulation.  I've worked on model/simulation development in the past, but now I'm working on instrumentation of our simulator to better understand the factors that affects its performance. </p>
<p>I received a BS in computer science from The University of North Carolina at Greensboro 
in May 2014, and just 3 credit hours short of a BA in mathematics.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy traveling, playing video games, drinking craft beer, hiking, CrossFit, playing board games, knitting, drawing and painting.  In the past, I lived in Germany a couple of years and did some traveling around Europe.  </p>
