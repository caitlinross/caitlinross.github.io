I'm a PhD candidate in the computer science department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
My current research is in performance analysis of parallel discrete event simulation.
Currently I am working on finishing up my thesis at Argonne National Laboratory as a visiting student as part of the Department of Energy's Graduate Student Research Program.

Originally from North Carolina, I received a BS in computer science from The University of North Carolina at Greensboro 
in May 2014.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, playing video games, drinking craft beer, hiking, CrossFit, playing board games, knitting, drawing and painting. 
In the past, I lived in Germany a couple of years and did some traveling around Europe.
