I'm a PhD candidate in the computer science department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 
My current research is in performance analysis of parallel discrete event simulation. 

I received a BS in computer science from The University of North Carolina at Greensboro 
in May 2014, and pretty much a BA in mathematics (just a couple of credit hours short).

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, playing video games, drinking craft beer, hiking, CrossFit, playing board games, knitting, drawing and painting. 
In the past, I lived in Germany a couple of years and did some traveling around Europe.
